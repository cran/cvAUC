# News for the cvAUC package. #


To Do
-----------------
* Finish re-writing `ci.cvAUC` and `ci.pooled.cvAUC` functions to use data.table sorting, which speeds up these functions by many orders of magnitude. 


cvAUC 1.0.1 (11-04-2014)
-----------------
* Added `AUC` utility function for simple AUC calculation (no cross-validation).
* Added example of `ci.pooled.cvAUC` function to documentation.
* Removed the `covProb.sim` simulation function.  This simulation should no longer be used.
* Prepended the `ROCR` package name to the `ROCR::performance` and `ROCR::prediction` functions inside the `AUC` and `cvAUC` functions.
* Removed `require(ROCR)` from functions since ROCR is a required dependency.
* Switched versioning convention from -0 to .0 in third digit.



cvAUC 1.0-0 (12-06-2012)
-----------------
* Initial CRAN release.
